  "Job Description": "The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) protects public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. We deliver 1.1 billion gallons of high-quality drinking water per day to 8.3 million New York City residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and we collect and treat an average of 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day. The Bureau of Environmental Planning and Analysis (BEPA) is responsible for conducting environmental reviews for DEP in accordance with all applicable City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) and State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR) regulations. In addition, this office provides technical assistance to other City agencies especially in the areas of air and noise quality and hazardous materials. The Office also provides technical assistance for the preservation of natural resources (wetlands remediation and development of natural landscaping plans) and conducts long range planning (population/employment, consumption and demand/flow) for the agency. The Bureau also conducts strategic planning to help ensure appropriate forecasting, trend analysis, regulatory review, scientific modeling, and research. In particular, the Bureau oversees the development of a watershed/sewer shed protection plan for Jamaica Bay, is continuing the work of the climate change task force and helps DEP plan for the new growth stimulated by rezoning throughout the city.  The In-House Design team at BEPA specializes in delivering cutting-edge civil engineering design solutions to support the green infrastructure (GI) vision of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYC-DEP). Our Engineering team is dedicated to designing and implementing large-scale green infrastructure (GI) projects that prioritize the capture of substantial volumes of stormwater annually to eliminate or remove mass pollutants, reduce CSO events, and mitigate the impact of extreme weather flooding. The BEPA In-House Design team is responsible for identifying and evaluating different large-scale green infrastructure (GI) and low-impact development (LID) practices, as well as exploring potential financing mechanisms to support these initiatives. The IHD team collaborates with various stakeholders, including the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to establish partnerships and effectively achieve these objectives.
